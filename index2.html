<H1>Why listen to TOOL?! </h1> 

 <p>
To be frank, there are litterally <b><span style="font-style:italic">THOUSANDS</SPAN></b> of reasons why one should 
listen to TOOL, but out of issues with conveniency, I have narrowed it down to 5 Key Points...
</p>



<ol>
<li>Because they produce Amazing music!</li>
<ul>
<li>Some examples include: ÆNEMA, Opiate, H., The Pot, Swamp Song, etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>Their music videos are works of art!</li>
<ul>
<li>In many of their music videos, the lead guitarist, Adam Jones, directed and produced many of the stop
motion scenes in the videos! Perfect examples are listed below:</li>
<li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hglVqACd1C8" target="_blank">Sober,</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07pLGIgyfjw" target="_blank">Stinkfist,</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5yTcK7b8Y" target="_blank">The Grudge,</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dABXvI1dxyg" target="_blank"> and Prison Sex (Nothing innapropriate).</a>

</li>
</ul>
<li>Individually, each are well established, super talented musicians!</li>

<li>The music is known to reach your soul, and have the ability to give you a psychadelic experience</li>
<li>Many of the lyrics deal with controversial issues</li>

<ul>
<li>Prison Sex is a fantastic example of this because it is singing about child abuse as well as cycles of abuse. Other examples
include songs like Sober ( dealing with issues of substance use) and H. (The lead singer Maynard, singing about his new-born son). 
</li>
</ul>

 <h1>Musical Style</h1>
 
 <p>TOOL uses a wide range of very innovative techniques to make their music stand out from the average band.
 Ranging from unusual time signatures, different tones on instruments, as well as increased polyrhythms in its
 drums, TOOL uses this to make their music very different, but incredibly amazing to listen to. Below is an excellent quote from
 the Wikipedia website discussing further information on their skills!
 </p>
 
 <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_(band)#Musical_style"><p>
 "Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: 
 After his performance during an Alice in Chains reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as "a natural fit at replacing Layne Staley".
 Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, The New York Times wrote that "both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity".

The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers.

According to Guitar Player magazine, Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques.
 For example, Allmusic wrote that he "alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism" in "Sober".
 Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a "pipe bomb microphone" (a guitar pickup mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a talk box guitar solo on "Jambi".
The band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with any album.
Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in "Lateralus". The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers and the song "Jambi" 
uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot iamb. The lyrics on Ænima and Lateralus focus on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from organized religion in "Opiate", to evolution and Jungian psychology 
in "Forty-Six & 2" and transcendence in "Lateralus". On 10,000 Days, Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him:the album name and title track refer to the twenty-seven years during which 
his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003."
